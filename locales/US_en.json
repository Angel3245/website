		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"text": "Here are some common questions we're asked for easy information.",
		"QAs": [
			{
				"question": "What is Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is an open source Nintendo Network replacement that aims to build custom servers for the Wii U and 3DS family of consoles. Our goal is to preserve the online functionality of these consoles, to allow players to continue to play their favorite Wii U and 3DS games to their fullest capacity"
			},
			{
				"question": "Will my existing NNIDs work on Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Sadly, no. Existing NNIDs will not work on Pretendo, as only Nintendo holds your user data; while an NNID-to-PNID migration is theoretically possible, it would be risky and require sensitive user data we do not wish to hold."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do I use Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is currently not in a state that is ready for public use. However, once it is you will be able to use Pretendo simply by running our homebrew patcher on your console."
			},
			{
				"question": "Is there an ETA for <feature>?",
				"answer": "We do not have an exact ETA for any specific features or the project as a whole. There are many parts to the network, updates release for them individually whenever they are ready (for example updates to the account server are (almost always) independent on other parts of the network, such as the friends server). Due to that, we cannot give an ETA."
			},
			{
				"question": "Does Pretendo work on Cemu/emulators?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is designed for the Wii U and 3DS hardware at heart; at this time the only emulator for these consoles with real online capability is Cemu. Cemu does not officially support custom servers, but it should still be possible to use Pretendo with Cemu<br>See the <a href=\"/cemu\">Cemu</a> page for more details"
			},
			{
				"question": "If I am account/console banned on Nintendo Network, will I stay banned when using Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Any account/console bans only exist server-side. This means any existing bans would not carry over to Pretendo. However, much like Nintendo Network, Pretendo will ban users/consoles for violations of our Terms of Agreement."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will Pretendo support the Wii/Switch?",
				"answer": "The Wii already has custom servers provided by <a href=\"https://wiimmfi.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiimmfi</a>. We currently do not wish to target the Switch as it is both paid and completely different to Nintendo Network.."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will I need hacks to connect?",
				"answer": "Yes, you will need to hack your device to connect; however, on Wii U you will only need access to the Homebrew Launcher (i.e. Haxchi, Coldboot Haxchi, or even the web browser exploit), with info on how the 3DS will connect coming at a later date."
